# Smart Plant Pot
Manage your plants from your phone and keep them alive.

## The Project
Smart Plant Pot lets you keep track of the soil moisture, air humidity, temperature of your plant and lets you also take pictures from it. It consist of three main parts:

1. **The Hardware:** The hardware setup consists of two sensors (soil moisture, temperature and air humidity) an a webcam, all connected to one Arduino and one Raspberry PI communicating with the back-end.
2. **The IOS APP:** Add and manage your plants, see whether they need watering or take a look at live pictures. It also lets you display all data in a histogram.
3. **The Back-End:** A SQL database and a REST API allow communication between your app and your plants and keep your data accessible at any time.
